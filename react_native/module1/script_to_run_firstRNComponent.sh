npx create-expo-app@latest --template blank firstRNComponent
cd firstRNComponent
npx expo start


# This works for the blanco app, now try copying the starter code from coursera into this blank structure:
# Don't copy the package.json file from coursera, just use the one that's generated in the blank project
# Then again just do:
cd firstRNComponent 
npx expo start
# And that works! 
# If that doesn't work (error 115), then force quit the simulator and try again (some update will be installed)
# OR try running npm run ios, sometimes that also works.
